# Hi, I'm Emily.

{{< image-card title="Let me introduce myself." subtitle="" img="headshot.jpg" >}}
I recently returned from my research stay as a visiting student with the AI for Data-Oriented Science ([AIDOS](https://aidos.group/)) Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Bastian Rieck](https://bastian.rieck.me/), funded by the 2024-2025 [Fulbright Study/Research](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) grant. 

Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree at [Bowdoin College](https://www.bowdoin.edu/), where I majored in math and minored in computer science. Go Polar Bears!

I am the proud younger sister of [Alex Simons](https://sites.google.com/view/alexandersimons/home?authuser=0), a wonderful math PhD student at the University of California, Davis, and, more importantly, a wonderful human.

I firmly believe in and am committed to upholding [Dr. Federico Ardila-Mantilla’s](https://fardila.com/) axioms:

* **Axiom 1.** Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

* **Axiom 2.** Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

* **Axiom 3.** Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

* **Axiom 4.** Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
