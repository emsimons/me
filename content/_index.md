# Hi, I'm Emily.

{{< image-card title="Let me introduce myself." subtitle="" img="headshot.jpg" >}}
I am currently based in Munich as a visiting student with the AI for Data-Oriented Science ([AIDOS](https://aidos.group/)) Lab, under the supervision of [Dr. Bastian Rieck](https://bastian.rieck.me/).

I am funded by a [Fulbright Study/Research](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) grant, and am co-affiliated with [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/) and the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).

I firmly believe in and am committed to upholding [Dr. Federico Ardila-Mantillaâ€™s](https://fardila.com/) axioms:

* **Axiom 1.** Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

* **Axiom 2.** Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

* **Axiom 3.** Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

* **Axiom 4.** Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
